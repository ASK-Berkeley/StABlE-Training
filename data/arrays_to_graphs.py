class AtomsToGraphs:
    """A class to help convert periodic atomic structures to graphs.

    The AtomsToGraphs class takes in periodic atomic structures in form of ASE atoms objects and converts
    them into graph representations for use in PyTorch. The primary purpose of this class is to determine the
    nearest neighbors within some radius around each individual atom, taking into account PBC, and set the
    pair index and distance between atom pairs appropriately. Lastly, atomic properties and the graph information
    are put into a PyTorch geometric data object for use with PyTorch.

    Args:
        max_neigh (int): Maximum number of neighbors to consider.
        radius (int or float): Cutoff radius in Angstroms to search for neighbors.
        r_energy (bool): Return the energy with other properties. Default is False, so the energy will not be returned.
        r_forces (bool): Return the forces with other properties. Default is False, so the forces will not be returned.
        r_distances (bool): Return the distances with other properties.
        Default is False, so the distances will not be returned.

    Attributes:
        max_neigh (int): Maximum number of neighbors to consider.
        radius (int or float): Cutoff radius in Angstoms to search for neighbors.
        r_energy (bool): Return the energy with other properties. Default is False, so the energy will not be returned.
        r_forces (bool): Return the forces with other properties. Default is False, so the forces will not be returned.
        r_distances (bool): Return the distances with other properties.
        Default is False, so the distances will not be returned.
